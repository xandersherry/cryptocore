cryptocore
==========

A cryptopgraphic library for .NET

CryptoCore encapsulates some of the more common symmetric crypto algorithms used by .NET, adding authenticated encryption with an implementation of AES-HMAC and AEAD algorithms from the CodePlex CLRSecurity project by Microsoft, which wraps the CNG algorithms provided by the Cryptograpic API:Next Generation now offered by Windows but not yet exposed by the core .NET framework.
